## HackOff v3.0

#### My first hacathonðŸ™ƒ

**Problem statement open inovation in Health care**

Our project is a fullscale web application that is responsible for letting a hospital admin to add or delete organs(kidney, lungs, pancreas) to the database once an organ is donated or taken from a particular hospital. Our solution also includes Plasma during the COVID situations. Our application also allows a normal user interaction apart from the hospital admin. A normal user can send a message in the app if he wishes to donate organs/plasma. That message is directlty sent to the Hospital email through an API. Our user can also search for organs that he needs urgently. Once the user selects the particular organ that he needs, a thorough search is made in the database and if that particular organ is present in out database, then the name of the Hospital along with all the details of that organ(age of the person who donated, sex of the person who donated etc) is displayed.

This hackathon was a huge confidence booster for me and my team. We got a price of 5000Rs each with MLH merchendice, in our very first hackathons.
